[Low Poly Gym Set - Unity Package]
[Ver 1.0]
.-------------------.


(Scroll down for further details)


The aim for this package is to just set-up things quickly, by providing ready-to-use prefabs of everything. This includes:

- Materials and original palette.
(if you're using URP, then you will need to convert these to URP, this is done with literally just one click from within Unity)
- Prefabs of models ready to place in scene, ready to be animated or manipulated from script (some are actual ready-to-use compositions of models).


*Look at my itch.io page for details*


--- Description ---

Decorate your low poly gym with this cool funiture pack (with machines, weights and other stuff to help you create a cool gym scenario!)

With separated weights, different machines to choose, and animatable parts you can easily customize everything and animate it the way you want :D (make parts interactive or tweak them the way you want). Now featuring a more clean palette containing only used colors rather than the entire usual thing.

Need help? Found some bug/problem? You have suggestions for future projects? Let me know!

You're free to use every model the way you want for any commercial / non-commercial project. (comments and mentions are always welcome and certainly appreciated)

I shouldn't need to clarify this, but just in case, remember you're not able to re-sell these models individually or as part of a model pack.

Please make sure to review the asset on itch.io if you found it useful, leave a comment there, feedback is always crucial!

[Notes]
* Some models may contain a second material, used to add more variation to certain parts of the model itself.

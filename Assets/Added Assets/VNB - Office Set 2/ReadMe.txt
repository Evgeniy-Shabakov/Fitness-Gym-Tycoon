 [Low Poly Office Set 2]
	  [Ver 1.0]
.-------------------.

(Scroll down for further details only in ENG for now)

The aim for this package is to just set-up things quickly, by providing ready-to-use prefabs of everything. This includes:

- Materials and original palette (with a second palette with minimal variation, you can always create more!).
(if you're using URP, then you will need to convert these to URP, this is done with literally just one click from within Unity)
- Prefabs of models ready to place in scene, ready to be animated or manipulated from script (some are actual ready-to-use compositions of models).

*Look at my itch.io page for details*


--- Description ---

Following my previous (and most successful) set I decided to expand it by creating a new complementary set, containing some more variations of the already present objects: more chairs, counters, lamps, paintings, desk and even donuts!

This is a smaller set compared to the previous one, yet still useful if you want to create a low poly office themed level, animation or composition.

If you need help, or find some bug/problem, make sure to contact me (links at the bottom), same if you come up with suggestions for future themes!

You're free to use every model the way you want for any commercial / non-commercial project. (comments and mentions are always welcome and certainly appreciated)

I shouldn't really need to clarify this, but just in case, remember you're not able to re-sell these models individually or as part of a model pack.

Please make sure to review the asset on itch.io if you found it useful, leave a comment there, along with any kind of suggestion (or problem you faced while using it) in order to improve it!

[Notes]
* Some models may contain a second material, used to add more variation to certain parts of the model itself.
